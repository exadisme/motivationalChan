PROJECT INFORMATION:

Written in bash. The script will detect the location where you place it when it is run. You may alter it to use an icon of your choosing.

You are free to use or modify this script as you wish. I just whipped it up for fun.

It is possible that I upgrade this script to use multiple different icons in the future.
