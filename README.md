# Motivational-Chan


#### **INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:**

Download the script and files, place them in your desired location.

Add the script executable to your DE/WM Autostart.


#### Configuration: 

The script will detect the location where you place it when it is run. You may alter it to use an icon of your choosing.


You may add more quotes to the motivational file. One quote per line for the script to work properly.

You may edit the script to use another icon or to increase or decrease the time between notifications.

#### **PROJECT INFORMATION:**

Written in bash. 

You are free to use or modify this script as you wish. I just whipped it up for fun.

It is possible that I upgrade this script to use multiple different icons in the future.
